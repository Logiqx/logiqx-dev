24/03/2008  *** v2.4 ***

            - Uses DatLib v2.24.
            - Fixed crash (allzip had spurious carriage returns in kyukaidk).
            - DatLib v2.11 to 2.23 also contained some relevant changes:
            - Added the Generic XML format.
            - Fixed bug that messed up internal indices (affected crc matching)
            - File identification is now done by loading just the first 4KB.
            - Fixed a rare crash (if the longest line in the dat was the last).

31/10/2005  *** v2.3 ***

            - Uses DatLib v2.10.
            - Fixed identification of ListXML for MAME+MESS v0.101u4 onwards.

22/07/2004  *** v2.2 ***

            - Uses DatLib v1.8.
            - Removed the need for xml2info by adding my own MAME XML parser.
            - A nice side effect is that names like "Alien³: The Gun" work now!
            - The parser also supports MESS XML.

11/07/2004  *** v2.1 ***

            - Updated the source to use the new functions of DatLib v1.4.
            - There is no functional change within ZIPFind though.

02/07/2004  *** v2.0 ***

            Modified to use DatLib - there are no game or ROM limits anymore!
            Also supports all DatLib formats (ListInfo, XML, RomCenter, etc).
            Note: For XML support to work, you need xml2info.exe in your path.

02/02/2003  *** v1.00 ***

            First public release.
