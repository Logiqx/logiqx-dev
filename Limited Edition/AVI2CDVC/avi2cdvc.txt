1. Introduction
---------------

When capturing DV source on a PC it is usually stamped with the FourCC 'dvsd'
and it therefore gets processed with the default DV codec of your PC (usually
Microsoft). I prefer to use the Canopus codec and in order to do this you must
change the FourCC to 'cdvc'. AVI2CDVC will allow you to quickly change the
FourCC of your AVI files and is also quite powerful in that it can change
all AVIs in a given directory, recursively processing all sub directories too
if you so desire.


2. Basic Usage
--------------

This tool is for use from the command line so place avi2cdvc.exe in your path.

   e.g. Extract avi2cdvc.exe into c:\windows

The way to change the FourCC of a single AVI file is by using this syntax:

	avi2cdvc test.avi

Similarly, you can also change all AVIs in a single directory with:

	avi2cdvc h:\captures\advc-50


3. Advanced Usage
-----------------

You can process multiple files and/or directories and optionally use wildcards:

	avi2cdvc test1.avi test2.avi test3.avi
or
	avi2cdvc test*.avi

You can recursively process all AVIs in a given directory using this syntax:

	avi2cdvc -r h:\captures\advc-50

You can change the FourCC of AVIs to any code that you desire with this syntax:

	avi2cdvc -f svcd test.avi


4. Tips
-------

I have a shortcut on my desktop that fixes all of the AVIs under my capture
directory. This is very useful and is simply:

	avi2cdvc -r h:\captures\advc-50

You might find a similar shortcut useful too!


5. Warnings
-----------

Be very careful with the recursive update facility, if you change any non-DV
AVIs to 'svcd' they will be unusable unless you turn them back to their correct
FourCC using the '-f' option. Do not blame me if you make an error!


6. Source
---------

I have included source for anyone who is interested or wants to see exactly how
it works. All that I ask is that you notify me if you make any changes that you
then distribute. Please give credit where it is due and do not distribute your
modifications without the source code or a readme.

To compile this tool, you will need to get DatLib from http://www.logiqx.com/


7. Bug reports
--------------

If you find any bugs please let me know about them.
