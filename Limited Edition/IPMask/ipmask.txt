Introduction
------------

IPMask is a handy utility for maintaining the IP masks on FTP servers.


Usage
-----

Edit host.ini then run ipmask.exe, that's it!

The section 'FTP' is where you put the hostname of your server, port number,
administrator username and the password.

Below that, just list your users and their host names/IP addresses. Be sure to
remember that usernames are case sensitive on the FTP server!

Important: Do not edit ipmask.ini by hand, it is maintained by ipmask.exe.


External Progams
----------------

IPMask requires Internet Utilities for Windows (release 1.04).

You need host.exe and whois.exe from inet32ut.zip

inetut32.zip is available from http://www.kiraly.com/software/utilities/


Source
------

As with all of my tools, I have included the source code so you can make
your own modifications but please do not distribute those versions. If
you make any useful changes then please send them to me so that I can
include them in future releases.

To compile this tool, you will need to get DatLib from http://www.logiqx.com/
