02/07/2004  *** v2.0 ***

            Wow, I never thought I'd get around to this rewrite but here it is!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uses DatLib - The new library for handling dats of many formats
===========

- A generic dat structure with various loading and cleansing routines.

- Far better memory handling. No longer uses huge blocks of fixed size memory.

  Info: DatUtil used to allocate almost 45MB for a dat when it was loaded.
        This was without MD5/SHA1 support and for a limited number of games!
        DatLib now allocates only what it really requires (which is usually
        about twice the size of the dat file).

- Multi-phase processing (pre-parse, parse, cleanse, save):

  - Pre-parser translates dat into an intermediate dat format.
  - Parser interprets the intermediate format to populate the dat structure.
  - Cleanser does things like 'lowercase', 'remove dups', 'fix merging', etc.
  - Saving outputs the cleansed dat structure in the required output format.

  Note: The main difference is the addition of the pre-parser (which removes
        common operations from the different dat parsers) and the separation
        of the cleansing operations from the loader (they used to be embedded
        in the various parsers, particularly painful for RomCenter format!).

- No limit on the number of games, ROMs, disks, samples etc.

- No limit on the length of file names, game titles, manufacturer names etc.

- Improved size and CRC handling (now numeric, not text based).

- Supports 'rebuildto' information for games.

- Supports alternative checksums (MD5 and SHA1).
  N.B. The directory scanner also generates MD5 and SHA1 checksums for files.

- Supports 'region' information of ROMs.

- Improved driver system for developers adding new dat formats.

- Fully supports the latest RomCenter dat format (2.50).

- Improved RomCenter parser is not case sensitive like the old one was.

- All cleansing features can now be used with all supported formats.

- Improved 'fix merging'. Now operates across clones, not just parent/clone.
  Also fixes bad parent references and prevents clones of clones.
  The feature is run by default when a data file is loaded into memory.
  A summary of fixes is shown in datutil.log, use -v option for full details.

- Duplicate ROMs are now removed when the data file is loaded into memory.

- Added debugging information (to help me track down problems).

- Removed alternate ROM support. It was only used by Shark and made data file
  comparisons unnecessarily complicated!

- Removed code that fixed the bad parent 'pc' in MESS dats (the default
  'fix merging' code does the same job now but without being hard coded).

- ClrMamePro log parser now supports disk images and alternative checksums.

- Nebula parser is now much better. With the default 'fix merging' behaviour,
  the data file that is generated should be almost usable now!

- Improved baddump and nodump handling.
  Also supports the syntax of MAME v0.68 (where the word 'flags' was missing).

- Improved logging. Added a verbose (-v) option for even more detail!

- You are given a warning if you try to convert a RomCenter data file where
  the plugin is not 'arcade.dll'. It is likely that such a conversion will
  not work correctly in ClrMamePro.

- The -g and -c options can now be used on resources. You can therefore
  extract games for neogeo, zn1, etc. (e.g. 'datutil -g cpzn1 -c mame.dat').

- Removed the dat comparison facility. Use MAMEDiff instead!

- Added load support for MAME ListXML format (uses the xml2info tool).

- Added a warning summary to datutil.log.
  Warnings are for missing details, funny ROM sizes and CRC conflicts.
  For full details of the warnings, use the DatUtil -v (verbose) option.

- Added details of all information that is lost when saving in a different
  format (e.g. Years and Manufacturers are lost when using RomCenter format).


Unsupported formats - Not included in the rewrite as they are of little use!

29/01/2004  *** v1.31 ***

              files must therefore have a [RESOURCES] section from now on.

            - Nebula drivers now output the correct 'romof' for Neo-Geo clones.

04/04/2002  *** v1.17 ***
            - Made 'fix-merging' option check the CRC as well as the name.
            - Fix merging option warns of CRC conflicts it finds. Useful test!
            - Strips trailing spaces from Nebula ROM names (for convenience).
            - Executable is called 'datutil.exe' again.

            - Improved sorting (ensures each parent precedes its clones).
            - RAINE and MESS files are converted to CMPro format by default.
            - Fixed a problem with the '-g' option and RAINE gameinfo files.
            - Increased maximum ROM size to 9 characters (~1GB) for U64Emu.
            - Increased number of lines scanned when identifying CMPro dats.
            - Source: Added a makefile and included a SAVE_ONLY_FORMAT.
            - Source: Changed parameter passing (uses a structure now).
            - Preliminary: 'Verify Merging' facility (currently disabled).

19/05/2000  *** v1.3 ***
            - RomCenter 2 support ('-f romcenter2').
            - New method of sorting (useful for RomCenter).
            - Two EXEs. This is because the long ROM name version eats memory
              and is slow on machines without much physical memory.
            - Improved handling of invalid parents.
            - Warns of funny ROM sizes.
            - Generates log of warnings during conversion.

28/04/2000  *** v1.2 ***
            - Increased game/rom name length to 80 characters.
              (DatUtil now requires even more memory for the dats!)
            - Minor string handling improvements. yawn...

08/04/2000  *** v1.1 ***
            - Added support for JFF.TXT, Sparcade RAT and JAS Romlist.
            - Increased maximum number of games from 4096 to 5000.
            - Increased game/rom name length to 50 characters.
              (DatUtil now requires a HUGE block of memory to hold the data)
            - Improved listinfo parser so that it can handle odd formatting.
            - Other minor modifications.

31/03/2000  *** v1.0 ***
